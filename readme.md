# C++ to Python Transpiler

This project read c++ code from source file (e.g. test.txt or any other but please update the path to the desired source file) and outputs the code (e.g. output.txt or any other but please update the path to the desired output file) in Python language for the Compiler Design Course. 

## The project is written in prolog and support the following statements:

* Signle Variable Declarations (e.g. int X;)
* Assignment Statements (e.g. x = y + 1;)
* Assignment Statements with Variable Declaration (e.g. int x = y + 1;)
* While Statements 
* Do While Statments
* If Statements 
* If else Statements

3. Open a CMD or Shell terminal in the project folder.
4. Run the following Command " swipl -s .\Compiler_Design_Prolog.pl " to run the SWI-Prolog.
5. Run " parse_code_from_file. " to run the program.
